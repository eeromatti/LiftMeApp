  <p>The workflow in a nutshell:
    <ol type="1">
        <li>Registration (only once) - enter your name, username, email, role (driver, passenger, both), home address or a preferred starting location, new password. </li>  
        <li>Sign in with your email and password</li>
        <li>After signing in, you will see a list of your matched users on the left panel. To filter relevant matches, adjust the commuting days and your preferred role using the toggles above the match list.</li>
        <li>Clicking a name in the list will show you the following information</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Driver selected</li>
          </ul>
    </ol>
  </p>
</div>    

    4. Clicking a name in the list will show you the following information:
    (driver selected)
      - commuting days of the other person
      - number of seats available in the other person's car
      - an extra distance and time required if the other person picks you from the address you have defined as your home address
      (passenger selected)
      - commuting days of the other person
      - the preferred pickup place of the other person (Home / Flexible)
      - an extra distance and time required if you pick the other person from home

      In both cases you will see an updated route on the map.
