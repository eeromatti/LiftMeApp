  <p>The animation of the game was created with a Python module called 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pygame">Pygame</a>. 
    The logic in the code is the following:
    <ul>
      <li>The platforms, coins, and ghosts are represented as groups of images, with their coordinates defined in a dictionary.</li>  
      <li>All elements (except for the robot) move downward at a predefined speed, which increases incrementally and makes it harder to stay in the game.</li>
      <li>A while loop updates the coordinates of these elements in each iteration. It also checks if the robot is moving, if it collects a coin or encounters a ghost, or if it falls out of the game.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
